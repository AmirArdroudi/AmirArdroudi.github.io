- I joined VOiD, back in 2018 as a programmer, to work on a story-drivern puzzle platformer adventure called Pursuit of Redemption.
- I started working on the Platformer (JetPack Levels) part of the game, and handled the mechanics and environment design of these levels.
- Moreover, I sharpened my knowdlege around the overall game feel, and put my knwoledge to use by juicing up the game, adding post-processing, camera shakes and cinematic movemenets, and customizable easing/tweening functions to it.
