- I have been developing educational math and science learning games for Legends of Learning compay over the past 2 years. 
- We have formed a team of 4, and we collabrate with each other remotely, via Jira, Miro, Git, etc.
- We have made 5 games for this company up to this date, and our games recieved an overwhelmingly postivie reviews and feedbacks from both teachers and students. Most of our games, are featured by Legends of Learning for teaching different learning objectives.
- After submitting each game, we recieve feedbacks and reviews by both Legends of Learnings technical and content reviewers, and this process helps us update our games and deliver an educative and fun experience.
- I am in charge of the technical side of developing these games, and I use Unity C# to develop WebGL games based on Legends of Learnings custom SDK, which is bascially a third party that connects our developed games to thier platform.
- Currently, I am developing a framework for Unity around Legends of Learning's SDK, to ease the development process of creating games for this company.
