Fun Climb is an arcade mobile game, developed by our small team of students in our University (University of Tabriz). It's a fun endless game that consists of various skins, upgrades, and unlockables. In this game, players control the character with gyroscope and climb using color-shifting buttons. A few of my friends and I presented this game as our bachelor degree's project.
