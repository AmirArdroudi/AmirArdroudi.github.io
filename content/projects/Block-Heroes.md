Block Heroes is an experimental game based on Tetris, built with the Ariyana engine, which has online multiplayer capability and replay system. It can be played [Block Heroes](https://gamejolt.com/games/blockheroes/515039) in GameJolt. I'm responsible for gameplay scripting in Beef Lang.
This game is a work in progress.
