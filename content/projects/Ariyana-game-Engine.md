Ariyana is a data-driven modular game engine which uses fiber system for enhancing multi-threading and provides scripting possibility with [beef language](https://www.beeflang.org/). 

In this project, I was responsible for creating the 2D system module and its scripting wrapper around beef.
Moreover, I've created [Ari2D-Tutorial](https://github.com/AmirArdroudi/Ari2D-Tutorial) which explains setting up the environment and scripting a 2D project in [Beef IDE](https://www.beeflang.org/docs/ide/)ðŸ¥©
