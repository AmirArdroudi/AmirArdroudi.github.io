![Event system based on scriptable objects](images/gameevent.png)

---

Programmed a modular system for handling events based on scriptable-object and UnityEvent in unity engine.
Developer/Designer could hook things up in editor, which comes handy in gameplay development and will help to isolate prefabs. The idea of this project was inspired by some conferences on game development which is referenced on the github repo.
