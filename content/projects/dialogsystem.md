Programmed a modular system for [handling events](https://github.com/AmirArdroudi/unity-custom-eventhandler') based on scriptable-object and UnityEvent in unity engine. Developer/Designer could hook things up in the editor, which comes in handy in gameplay development and will help to isolate prefabs. The idea of this project was inspired by some conferences on game development which is referenced on the Github repo.
Also, I've built a Dialog System upon this event handler in Unity. all the dialog data are separated from the logic and stored in Dialog scriptable objects.
