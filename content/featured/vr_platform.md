Developed a handy platform for game/environment designers who want to create their prototype game on a VR platform. It mainly provides tools for editing and creating various gameplay mechanics. This project is created in our university's innovation center. This is still a work in progress.


**My responsibilities in this game were:**
- Tool programming and tech-lead management
- Serializing and deserializing all actions and parameters that are not serializable by default
- Creating a reliable save/load system
