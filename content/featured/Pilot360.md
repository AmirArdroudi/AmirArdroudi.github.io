The Pilot 360 is a game that helps students to understand equal partitioning and unit iteration to understand angle and turn measure. Primarily, I developed and programmed the game and contributed in gameplay design. The challenging part was to conduct and create the mechanics related to trigonometry, the presented new obstacles and complexity gave me the opportunity to work on practical applications of these mathematical ideas.  
This project was accepted upon the first review and overall was a very successful game in related objectives.
