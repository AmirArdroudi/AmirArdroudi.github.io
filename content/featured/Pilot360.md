The Pilot 360 is a game that helps students to understand equal partitioning and unit iteration to understand angle and turn measure. This project was accepted upon the first review and overall was a very successful game in related objectives. 
<!-- I am in charge of the technical side of developing these games, and I use Unity C# to develop WebGL games based on Legends of Learnings custom SDK, which is a third party that connects our developed games to their platform. -->

**My responsibilities in this game were:**
- Solving challenging problems around trigonometry math in gameplay mechanics 
- Developing the game and contributing in gameplay design
