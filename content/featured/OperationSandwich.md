The Sandwich-Operation will serve as a math game that teaches students how to apply mathematics in real-world problems that involve operations on rational numbers. In this game, you work as a new employee at SandiShop. You should deliver the orders and calculate the bill.
This project was particularly challenging because it was the first time working with this company, I have developed and programmed the game in conjunction with my teammate's design, some of the challenges that I faced was working with the custom new SDK that LoL provided, connecting to the API (sending and receiving messages and authentication), and we faced a very condensed timeline and fortunately, we met the deadline. This project prepared me to tackle many projects in the future with ease.
