The Sandwich-Operation will serve as a math game that teaches students how to apply mathematics in real-world problems that involve operations on rational numbers. In this game, you work as a new employee at SandiShop. You should deliver the orders and calculate the bill. This project was particularly challenging because it was the first time working with this company. We faced a very condensed timeline and fortunately, we met the deadline. This project prepared me to tackle time limits and working under pressure. 

**My responsbilities in this game were:**
 - developing the game in conjunction with my team member's design
 - working with the custom new SDK that LoL provided, connecting to the API (sending and receiving messages)
