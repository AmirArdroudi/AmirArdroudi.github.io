In Decimal Discovery, Players enter the world of Barlingons and take control of an abandoned spaceship which belongs to humans. Players will fly the ship through 4 different planets of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, in which they will learn about decimal numbers and how to add, subtract, multiply, and divide them, in order to disintegrate the obstacles in their way and reach earth to meet humans. Students will learn all about decimal numbers with interactive tutorials and fun and engaging gameplay, and by the time that the journey is over, they will know all they need to know about Arithmetic with Decimals.
