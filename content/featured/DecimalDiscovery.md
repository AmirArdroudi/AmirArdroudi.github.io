In Decimal Discovery, players enter the world of Barlingons and take control of an abandoned spaceship which belongs to humans. Players will fly the ship through 4 different planets of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, in which they will learn about decimal numbers and how to add, subtract, multiply, and divide them, to disintegrate the obstacles in their way and reach the earth to meet humans. Students will learn all about decimal numbers with interactive tutorials and fun and engaging gameplay, and by the time that the journey is over, they will know all they need to know about Arithmetic with Decimals. In this game, I've tried to create more handy and flexible tools for designers and artists, which encouraged me to watch a lot of conferences and read articles about it in [ GDC (Game Development Conferences)](https://gdconf.com/) as well as other sources. This was a very enjoyable journey because I always try to stay up to date on new technologies and best practices used by industry developers.

**My responsibilities in this game were:**
- Designing a flexible game architecture based on scriptable objects and Unityevent.  
- Creating a designer-friendly event system handler
- Implementing a customizable [easing/tweening wrapper](https://github.com/AmirArdroudi/MyDoTweenWrapper) for DoTween library in unity
- Working with new LOL SDK to handle save/load system 
- Using [Miro](https://miro.com/) for collaborating online with other team members
