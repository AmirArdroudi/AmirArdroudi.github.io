The Shapey Tower was an attempt at gamification of shapes and their properties. This was also an educational game, the main objective of which was to understand various qualities of shapes in form of mathematical objects. The gameplay idea was inspired by matching games.
My part was to develop and program the game. As I was an experienced developer in this field I tried to bring optimization and boosting ideas to this project which led to an enhanced game feel and efficient resource management. All of this encouraged me to watch a lot of conferences and read articles about juicing up the game from [ GDC (Game Development Conferences)](https://gdconf.com/) as well as other sources. This was a very enjoyable journey because I always try to stay up to date on new technologies and best practices used by industry developers.
