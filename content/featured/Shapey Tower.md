The Shapey Tower was an attempt at gamification of shapes and their properties. This was also an educational game, the main objective of which was to understand various qualities of shapes in form of mathematical objects. The gameplay idea was inspired by matching games.
Its demo could be played on [Legends of Learning platform](https://games.legendsoflearning.com/game/shapey-tower/2733?partner=legends-public&media=game). 

**My responsibilities in this game were:**
- Developing the gameplay, UI ,and tools
- Creating a playable prototype in early stages of development
