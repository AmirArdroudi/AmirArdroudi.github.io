In this game you work as a new employee at SandiShop. You should deliver the orders and calculate the bill.\nThis project was particularly challenging because it was the first time working with this company, I have developed and programmed the game in conjunction with my teammate's design, some of the challenges that I faced was working with the custom new SDK that LoL provided, connecting to the API (sending and receiving messages and authentication), and we faced a very condensed timeline and fortunately we met the deadline. This project prepared me to tackle many projects in the future with ease.</p>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Shapey Tower","tech":["Unity","C#","Webgl","LegendsOfLearning"],"github":"","external":"https://games.legendsoflearning.com/game/shapey-tower/2733?partner=legends-public&media=game"},"html":"<p>Dec 2019</p>\n<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"282\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zUUc8a1Q0O4\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\" clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<hr>\n<p>ll l l ll l ll ll l l ll l l ll ll l l ll l ll ll l l ll l l ll ll l l ll l ll ll l l ll l l ll </p>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Unity VR Platform","tech":["Unity","VR","HTC Vive","C#"],"github":"https://github.com/Vonderbird/VR_platform","external":""},"html":"<p>Aug 2020  </p>\n<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"282\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OeSEkeHIHRg\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<hr>\n<p>Developed a handly platform for game/environment designers who whats to create their prototype game in VR.
