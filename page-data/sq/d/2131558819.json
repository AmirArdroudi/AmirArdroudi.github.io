Players will fly the ship through 4 different planets of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, in which they will learn about decimal numbers and how to add, subtract, multiply, and divide them, in order to disintegrate the obstacles in their way and reach earth to meet humans. Students will learn all about decimal numbers with interactive tutorials and fun and engaging gameplay, and by the time that the journey is over, they will know all they need to know about Arithmetic with Decimals.</p>\n<p><strong>My responsbilities in this game were:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Creating a designer friendly event system handler</li>\n<li>Using Miro for collaborating online with other team members</li>\n<li>Working with new LOL SDK to handle save/load system </li>\n<li>Developing a wrapper around DoTween third-party</li>\n</ul>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Operation-Sandwich","tech":["Unity","C#","Webgl"],"github":"","external":"https://www.legendsoflearning.com/learning-objectives/real-world-problems-with-rational-numbers-math-games/","company":"Legends of Learning"},"html":"<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"282\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/toYvUEbnXSk\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<hr>\n<p><small> May 2019 </small> </p>\n<p>The Sandwich-Operation will serve as a math game that teaches students how to apply mathematics in real-world problems that involve operations on rational numbers. In this game, you work as a new employee at SandiShop. You should deliver the orders and calculate the bill. This project was particularly challenging because it was the first time working with this company. We faced a very condensed timeline and fortunately, we met the deadline. This project prepared me to tackle time limits and working under pressure. </p>\n<p><strong>My responsbilities in this game were:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>developing the game in conjunction with my team member's design</li>\n<li>working with the custom new SDK that LoL provided, connecting to the API (sending and receiving messages)</li>\n</ul>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Shapey Tower","tech":["Unity","C#","Webgl"],"github":"","external":"https://games.legendsoflearning.com/game/shapey-tower/2733?partner=legends-public&media=game","company":"Legends of Learning"},"html":"<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"282\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zUUc8a1Q0O4\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\" clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<hr>\n<p><small>Dec 2019</small></p>\n<p>The Shapey Tower was an attempt at gamification of shapes and their properties. This was also an educational game, the main objective of which was to understand various qualities of shapes in form of mathematical objects. The gameplay idea was inspired by matching games.\nMy part was to develop and program the game. As I was an experienced developer in this field I tried to bring optimization and boosting ideas to this project which led to an enhanced game feel and efficient resource management. All of this encouraged me to watch a lot of conferences and read articles about juicing up the game from <a href=\"https://gdconf.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"> GDC (Game Development Conferences)</a> as well as other sources. This was a very enjoyable journey because I always try to stay up to date on new technologies and best practices used by industry developers.</p>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Unity VR Platform","tech":["Unity","VR","HTC Vive","SteamVR","C#"],"github":"https://github.com/Vonderbird/VR_platform","external":"","company":null},"html":"<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"282\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OeSEkeHIHRg\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<hr>\n<p><small>Aug 2020</small></p>\n<p>Developed a handy platform for game/environment designers who want to create their prototype game on a VR platform.

Primarily, I developed and programmed the game and contributed in gameplay design. The challenging part was to conduct and create the mechanics related to trigonometry, the presented new obstacles and complexity gave me the opportunity to work on practical applications of these mathematical ideas.<br>\nThis project was accepted upon the first review and overall was a very successful game in related objectives.  </p>"}}]}}}
