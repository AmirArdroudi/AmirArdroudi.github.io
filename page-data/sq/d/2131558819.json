This was also an educational game whose main objective was to understand various qualities of shapes in form of mathematical objects. The gameplay idea was inspired by matching games.\nMy part was to develop and program the game. As I was an experienced developer in this field I tried to bring optimization and boosting ideas to this project which led to an enhanced game feel and very efficient resource management. All of this encouraged me to watch a lot of conferences and read articles about juicing up the game from<a href=\"https://gdconf.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"> GDC (Game Development Conferences)</a> as well as other sources. This was a very enjoyable journey because I always try to stay up to date on new technologies and best practices used by industry developers.</p>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Operation-Sandwich","tech":["Unity","C#","Webgl"],"github":"","external":"https://www.legendsoflearning.com/learning-objectives/real-world-problems-with-rational-numbers-math-games/","company":"Legends of Learning"},"html":"<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"282\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/toYvUEbnXSk\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<hr>\n<p><small> May 2019 </small> </p>\n<p>The Sandwich-Operation will serve as a math game that teaches students how to apply mathematics in real-world problems that involve operations on rational numbers. In this game, you work as a new employee at SandiShop. You should deliver the orders and calculate the bill.\nThis project was particularly challenging because it was the first time working with this company, I have developed and programmed the game in conjunction with my teammate's design, some of the challenges that I faced was working with the custom new SDK that LoL provided, connecting to the API (sending and receiving messages and authentication), and we faced a very condensed timeline and fortunately, we met the deadline. This project prepared me to tackle many projects in the future with ease.</p>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Shapey Tower","tech":["Unity","C#","Webgl"],"github":"","external":"https://games.legendsoflearning.com/game/shapey-tower/2733?partner=legends-public&media=game","company":"Legends of Learning"},"html":"<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"282\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zUUc8a1Q0O4\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\" clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<hr>\n<p><small>Dec 2019</small></p>\n<p>The Shapey Tower was an attempt at gamification of shapes and their properties.

It mainly provides tools for editing and various gameplay mechanics. This project is created in our university innovation center. I was responsible for tech lead and management, also tool programming. This is still a work in progress. One of its major features is the ability to serialize/deserialize all actions and parameters that are not serializable by default, with a reliable save/load system. You can find the open source <a href=\"https://github.com/Vonderbird/VR_platform\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">repo</a> on Github, all contributions are welcomed. ðŸ‘¾</p>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Pilot360","tech":["Unity","C#","Webgl"],"github":"","external":"https://games.legendsoflearning.com/game/pilot-360/2515?partner=legends-public&media=game","company":"Legends of Learning"},"html":"<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"282\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DhxuXCJmFrU\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\" clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<hr>\n<p><small>Jun 2019</small>  </p>\n<p>The Pilot 360 is a game that helps students to understand equal partitioning and unit iteration to understand angle and turn measure. Primarily, I developed and programmed the game and contributed in gameplay design. The challenging part was to conduct and create the mechanics related to trigonometry, the presented new obstacles and complexity gave me the opportunity to work on practical applications of these mathematical ideas.<br>\nThis project was accepted upon the first review and overall was a very successful game in related objectives.  </p>"}}]}}}
